Just kidding.\n\nWe\u2019re your hosts Brandi Egan and Kristin Caruso. What we lack in legal training we more than make up for in being completely obsessed with lawsuits. Every week, we discuss two juicy legal battles. Each episode is peppered with Brandi\u2019s booming laugh and Kristin\u2019s Olympic-level talent for putting the word \u201cso\u201d into every sentence.\n\nThe podcast started in 2018, but we\u2019ve been having these conversations for years. What can we say? We\u2019re just a couple of lifelong friends who love the drama of a trial.

At least, that\u2019s what the local sheriff thought. So he hired a guy named Tom Coleman to work as an undercover narcotics agent. What Tom discovered was truly unbelievable. As it turned out, the little town of approximately 5,000 people was home to *at least* 46 drug dealers. On top of that, the drug dealers in this economically depressed community dealt oodles of powder cocaine! Oh, and guess what?? Even though Tulia had a pretty small Black community, almost every single drug dealer that Tom encountered was Black! What are the odds??? Thanks to Tom\u2019s undercover work, authorities arrested 46 people on drug charges. But Tom hadn\u2019t worn a wire during these drug buys. Nothing was videoed or photographed. He hadn\u2019t even worked alongside another undercover agent. Hell, he hadn\u2019t even written his notes on a notepad. He\u2019d written every pertinent detail about those drug deals on his leg.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nThen Brandi tells us about the murder of Ingrid Lyne. Indrid was a newly divorced, busy mom. She shared three daughters with her ex-husband, Phillip, and she worked as a nurse at Seattle\u2019s Swedish Medical Center. She\u2019d just recently begun online dating. Through an app, she met John Charlton. John seemed like a nice enough guy, so Ingrid went out with him a few times. But on the morning after Ingrid went to a Seattle Mariners game with John, her friends and family couldn\u2019t get a hold of her.\u00a0<br />\n<br />\nAnd now for a note about our process.

She\u2019d married her military husband following a whirlwind romance a few years earlier. Shortly after they married, the Navy relocated the couple to San Diego. So, Elizabeth found herself far from friends and family, often alone, with two young children. She and her husband, Matthew, argued. He got violent with her. Elizabeth told her friends she\u2019d had enough. She was going to leave Matthew.

Young women were being raped late at night, often while they were parking their cars. Police sketches of the attacker all looked different enough that many young Black men were afraid to go on campus late at night, for fear that they\u2019d be mistaken for the Tech Rapist.

They cleared dirt off of it. They soon realized that they hadn\u2019t hit a stone; they\u2019d hit a gigantic foot. They kept digging. When they cleared all the dirt away, they realized that they were looking at the petrified body of a giant. T\u2019was a sight to behold! He was a full blown meaty boi!<br />\n<br />\n*Kristin first told this story during our live episode taping at Obsessed Fest, where she was so nervous that she couldn\u2019t talk about the Cardiff Giant\u2019s massive dong. Brandi, however, had no such misgivings. We\u2019ll put the recording from the live show on Patreon at the $10 level as soon as we get it. In the meantime, please enjoy this recording straight from the sex dungeon.<br />\n<br />\nAnd now for a note about our process. For each episode, Kristin reads a bunch of articles, then spits them back out in her very limited vocabulary. Brandi copies and pastes from the best sources on the web. And sometimes Wikipedia. (No shade, Wikipedia. We love you.) We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the real experts who covered these cases.<br />\n<br />\n<em>In this episode, Kristin pulled from:</em><br />\n\u201cThe giant in the earth,\u201d by Stephen Sears for American Heritage<br />\n\u201cWhen giants roamed the earth,\u201d by Mark rose for Archaeology\u00a0<br />\n\u201cThe Cardiff giant hoax,\u201d by James Taylor Dunn for New York History<br />\n\u201cThe Cardiff giant was just a big hoax,\u201d by Kat Eschner for Smithsonian Magazine<br />\n\u201cFake of a fake of a fake: A giant tale of local lore,\u201d by Gerald Smith for Press Connects</div>\n<br />\n<div>YOU\u2019RE STILL READING?
