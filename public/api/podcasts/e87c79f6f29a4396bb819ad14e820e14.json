In August 2019, Epstein would be found dead in his jail cell after an apparent suicide. But the story is far from over. Still-open civil lawsuits, a fight over Epstein's estate and questions about alleged accomplices all linger.

Victims ?from Florida, New York and New Mexico are interviewed by the FBI ?over the course of two years -- and ?they are assured that the wheels of justice are turning. But what eventually happens stuns Palm Beach police and the women who, despite fearing for their safety, opened up old wounds to cooperate with federal investigators. How did the millionaire from Palm Beach, accused of sexually abusing potentially over 30 girls and young women across the country, end up spending just over a year in a local jail cell that allowed to come and go almost as he pleased? Just who was behind the \"sweetheart\" deal Epstein got, leaving victims both angry and betrayed? And new information from ABC News shows federal investigators knew even more years ago than has been previously reported about allegations against Epstein -- this time, surrounding a 14-year old girl in New York. \"Truth and Lies: Jeffrey Epstein\" is a co-production of the award-winning ABC News Investigative Unit and ABC Audio, makers of \"The Dropout,\" \"A Killing On the Cape,\" \"Have You Seen This Man?,\" the daily ABC News podcast \"Start Here,\" and more: http://www.abcaudio.com/podcasts</p>", "pub_date_ms": 1582192800002, "audio": "https://www.listennotes.com/e/p/f406a0b771f2470bb65169e74c002719/", "audio_length_sec": 4162, "listennotes_url": "https://www.listennotes.com/e/f406a0b771f2470bb65169e74c002719/", "image": "https://production.listennotes.com/podcasts/truth-and-lies/ep-8-the-sweetheart-deal-JQyYoIdWMcE-Px8EBGqmVyJ.300x300.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://production.listennotes.com/podcasts/truth-and-lies/ep-8-the-sweetheart-deal-JQyYoIdWMcE-Px8EBGqmVyJ.300x300.jpg", "maybe_audio_invalid": false, "listennotes_edit_url": "https://www.listennotes.com/e/f406a0b771f2470bb65169e74c002719/#edit", "explicit_content": false, "link": "https://abcaudio.com/podcasts/truth-and-lies-informant/?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website", "guid_from_rss": "qLvWovGQASWFiVObbFf3IJmFcytsSm6H"}, {"id": "40ce1bcf6e844ad0948af1d2af5a9b00", "title": "Ep. 7: Little St. Jeff", "description": "<p>Jeffrey Epstein further expands his real estate empire with arguably his most extravagant purchase, a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands called Little St. James, that he dubbed \"Little St. Jeff.\" A contractor who did a lot of work on the island says he witnessed things he found terribly unsettling, including young-looking girls sunbathing on the beaches.
