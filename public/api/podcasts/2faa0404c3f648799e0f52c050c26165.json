      "title": "Part Cookie, Part Pastry, All Delicious! Malted Milk Chocolate Rugelach",
      "description": "<p>Rugelach is a beloved Jewish treasure originating from Eastern Europe. The cookie-pastry hybrid can be filled with anything from jam to chocolate and is the perfect two-bite treat fit for any holiday spread. This version, a classic chocolate rugelach bolstered with the flavors of creamy milk chocolate and malted milk powder, has a nostalgic flavor and tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture that will shine at any cookie swap.</p><p><a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/88695-malted-milk-chocolate-rugelach-recipe\"><strong>Recipe</strong></a></p><p>16 Rugelach\u00a0</p><p><i>Dough</i></p><ul><li>2 1/4 cups (288g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li><li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li><li>1/4 cup (40g) malted milk powder</li><li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li>1 cup (2 sticks/226g) cold unsalted butter, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes</li><li>8 ounces (226g) cold cream cheese, cut into \u00bd-inch cubes</li></ul><p><i>Malted Milk Chocolate Filling</i></p><ul><li>4 ounces (about \u2154 cup/113g) milk chocolate chips or chopped milk chocolate</li><li>1/3 cup (53g) malted milk powder</li><li>1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon (6g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li>1 large egg, for egg wash, plus more if needed</li><li>sanding sugar, for sprinkling</li></ul><ol><li><i>Make the dough</i>: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, combine the flour, sugar, \u00bc cup malted milk powder, and salt. Process until combined, 10 to 15 seconds. Add the butter and cream cheese and process until a rough, shaggy dough forms that just starts to pull away from the sides of the food processor, 30 to 45 seconds. (If you don\u2019t have a food processor you can pinch and knead the butter and cream cheese into the dry ingredients using clean hands as if you are making pie dough.) Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured work surface, cut in half, and roughly form each half into a rectangle. (Wipe out the food processor, but don\u2019t wash it.) Tightly cover in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, up to overnight.</li><li><i>Make the filling</i>: Place the chocolate chips, malted milk powder, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a blade attachment and process until the mixture is the texture of coarse sand, 25 to 35 seconds. (Alternatively, chop the chocolate into a fine dust and mix with the other ingredients.) Transfer into a bowl and set aside. In another small bowl, crack the egg for the egg wash and beat with a fork until no streaks of unincorporated yolk remain.</li><li>Unwrap one of the chilled doughs, generously dust with flour, and roll into a 11- by 8-inch rectangle. (The dough can get sticky, so use a bit more flour than normal.) Trim the edges to create crisp lines, if desired. Sprinkle about half of the filling onto the dough in an even layer leaving a \u00bd-inch border on the top and bottom, pressing it in with your hands so it sticks and compacts slightly. Brush the top and bottom border with the egg wash. Roll into a spiral shape, brushing the underside of the dough with egg wash each time you roll it over, and transfer onto a sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling and freeze both logs uncovered for 1 hour.</li><li>As the cookie logs are chilling, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F and set 2 racks at the upper-middle and lower-middle positions. Line 2 baking sheets (you can line the one in the freezer once the logs are done chilling) with parchment paper or nonstick baking mats.</li><li>Brush the chilled dough logs with the egg wash on all sides. (If your egg wash has a lot of chocolate in it, it\u2019s best to make a new one.) Generously sprinkle the tops of the logs with the sanding sugar. Cut the logs into 1\u00bd-inch thick slices using a thin sharp knife and place onto the prepared baking sheets spacing at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes until lightly browned, then let cool completely on the baking sheet before serving. (If any of the rugelach spread more than you would have liked, just use the back of a spoon to push them back together while still hot from the oven.)</li></ol>",

Add the melted butter, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and stir together until a soft dough forms. Transfer the dough into the lined baking pan and press into an even layer. Prick the top several times with a fork and bake until the shortbread is slightly puffed and golden brown in the center, 33 to 38 minutes. Remove from the oven and use the bottom of a measuring cup or a metal spatula to press down on the shortbread to compact it slightly. (This will prevent the bars from crumbling when sliced.) Let the shortbread cool for 30 minutes.</li><li><i>While the shortbread is cooling, make the caramel</i>: In a medium saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, combine the brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, sweetened condensed milk, speculoos cookie butter, vanilla, and salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often to prevent burning, until the mixture is smooth, glossy, and registers 240\u00b0F on the candy thermometer, about 8 to 11 mins. Pour over the shortbread base, spread into an even layer, and transfer into the fridge. Let cool for 1 hour.</li><li><i>As the caramel is cooling, make the topping</i>: Place both the white and semisweet chocolate chips in two separate medium, microwave-safe bowls. Add 2 tablespoons whole milk and 1 tablespoon cookie butter to each bowl. Microwave each bowl on high power in 10 second increments, stirring between each, until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds total. Transfer the white chocolate ganache into a piping bag or zip-top baggie.</li><li>Working quickly, pour the dark chocolate ganache over top of the caramel and spread into an even layer. Pipe thin, straight lines of the white chocolate ganache all going the same way. (You might not need all of the ganache.) Use a toothpick to drag it through the lines, alternating the direction you go each time to create a rough chevron pattern. Transfer the bars into the fridge and let set for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Sprinkle the top of the bars with flaky sea salt and cut into a 3 by 8 grid to make 24 bars. (For cleaner edges, feel free to trim off the border of the pan before slicing.) Serve chilled or at room temperature.</li></ol><p>Is there a recipe you'd like to hear us make?

Add the anchovies to the skillet and cook them slowly, mashing with a wooden spoon until they melt into the oil. (Don\u2019t let the oil get too hot or it will fry the anchovies rather than melt them.)</li><li>Add the garlic and oregano to the anchovies and saut\u00e9 for a few minutes. (Get your face in there and take a whiff of that glorious aroma.)</li><li>Finally, add the tomatoes to the skillet, season with the salt and pepper, and let simmer for 20 minutes. Serve while warm, or let cool and then keep in airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</li><li><i>To serve:</i> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add half the gnocchi and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or according to package instructions if using store-bought. When they float to the surface, it\u2019s a good indication they\u2019re done. Pop one in your mouth to make sure it\u2019s cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked gnocchi into the warm sauce. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi.</li></ol><p>Gnocchi\u00a0</p><ol><li>In a large wide pot, add the potatoes and enough water to cover them (you\u2019ll also cook the gnocchi in this pot). Bring to a boil and cook until a sharp knife poked into a potato meets only a little resistance, 35 to 40 minutes. Turn off the heat. Remove the potatoes from the water and, when cool enough to handle, remove the skins.</li><li>Using a ricer, box grater, or Microplane, pass or grate the potatoes into a fine consistency, making sure there are no lumps. Spread the potatoes out on a baking sheet to dry out and cool a little.</li><li>In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, egg, pecorino, salt, and pepper. Gradually add the flour and use your hands to combine everything and bring the dough together.</li><li>Place the dough on a clean, dry, lightly floured work surface and knead just until the dough comes together in a smooth ball. If the dough feels a little sticky, add a bit more flour. If you won\u2019t be rolling out immediately, cover with a piece of plastic wrap.</li><li>Dust a large baking sheet with flour. Lightly flour a large wooden cutting board or work surface. Take a small piece of dough and roll it into a snake about 3\u20444 inch thick. Using a sharp knife, cut the snake into pieces about a thumb\u2019s width. (If you\u2019d like to give your gnocchi a little flair, roll the cut pieces along the tines of a gnocchi paddle or a fork.) Place the gnocchi on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat the process with the remaining dough.</li><li>If cooking within a couple of hours, leave the baking sheet on the counter. To store, freeze in a single layer of gnocchi on the baking sheet, transfer the frozen pasta to a ziplock bag or airtight container, and freeze for about 1 month. To cook, don\u2019t defrost, just boil frozen; otherwise, they will fall apart.</li></ol><p>Is there a recipe you'd like to hear us make?
