The two broke into the family home and searched for the safe, they then woke up the family when they couldn't find it, tortured and murdered them one by one.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>thank you to exquisite David White for research assistance&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>References</p><p>Capital Wire Service. 1959. \"Two Itinerant Laborers Held for Murder Quiz.\" <em>Topeka Daily Capital</em>, November 20.</p><p>Capote, Truman. 1965. \"In Cold Blood.\" <em>The New Yorker</em>, September 25.</p><p>Cowan, Carole. 2005. \"Persons Unknown.\" <em>New York Times</em>, Jan 23: F6.</p><p>Garden City Telegram. 1965. \"Last Words Attack Capital Punishment.\" <em>Garden City Telegram</em>, April 14: 1.</p><p>Gonsalves, Antone. 1984. \"25 years later, 'In Cold Blood' murders still haunt.\" <em>United Press International</em>, November 11.</p><p>Greer, Bob. 1959. \"Clutter Family Murders.\" <em>Garden City Telegram</em>, November 16: 1.</p><p>Hegeman, Roxana. 2009. \"The Stains of In Cold Blood Still Fresh 50 Years Later.\" <em>Guelph Mercury</em>, November 10.</p><p>Hickock, Richard. 1960. \"Spectre of Noose Haunts Prisoner.\" <em>Topeka Daily Capital</em>, March 25.</p><p>Kalbfleisch, Gay. 1959. \"Empty Shell Cases, Fatal Shot Found.\" <em>Topeka Daily Capital</em>, November 19: 1.</p><p>Keglovitts, Sally J. 2004. \"In Cold Blood Revisited: A Look Back at an American.\" <em>Federal Probation: A Journal of Correctional Philosophy and Practice</em> 68 (1).</p><p>Kull, Ron. 1960. \"Crime Plans Listed.\" <em>Topeka Daily Capital</em>, 03 24: 1.</p><p>\u2014. 1960. \"'They'll Both Get the Rope'.\" <em>Topeka State Journal</em>, March 23: 1.</p><p>\u2014. 1960. \"'Wells Was to Get Cut,' Says Hickock.\" <em>Topeka State Journal</em>, March 26.</p><p>McAvoy, Gary. 2019. <em>And Every Word is True.</em> Bremerton, WA: Literati Editions.</p><p>New York Times. 1959. \"Wealthy Farmer, 3 of Family Slain.\" <em>New York Times</em>, November 16: 39.</p><p>State Journal News Services. 1960. \"Jury Tours Clutter Farm; Death Asked.\" <em>Topeka State Journal</em>, March 23.</p><p><em>State of Kansas vs. Hickock &amp; Smith.</em> 1961. 363 P.2d 541 (Supreme Court of Kansas, July 8).</p><p>Time Magazine. 1960. \"Kansas: The Killers.\" <em>Time Magazine</em>, January 18.</p><p>Topeka State Journal. 1965. \"Clutter Case Reporter Finds Relief in End of Long Story.\" <em>Topeka State Journal</em>, April 14: 1.</p><p>United Press International. 1959. \"Fear, Grief Follow Murder Shock.\" <em>Topeka Daily Capital</em>, November 16: 1.</p><p><br /></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",

      "description": "<p>On March 4th, 1999 the body of Cordell Richards was found in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. The man had been absolutely brutalized. He was tied to a tree, beaten, burned, and had his throat cut. The medical examiner notices something strange though; he found maggots present at the scene but some of them had been charred. This meant that the man had likely been burned after his body had already begun decomposing. Why would the killer(s) come back after the fact? And better yet, who had done this to the 31 year old father of two?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you to the lovely David White for research assistance!&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p><p>Associated Press. 1999. \"Teens charged with veteran's death.\" Lakeland Ledger, March 19.</p><p>\u2014. 2000. \"Teen emotional as lawyer describes scene of slaying.\" Ocala Star-Banner, February 16.</p><p>\u2014. 2000. \"Video shows suspects returning cleaver.\" Ocala Star-Banner, March 18.</p><p>\u2014. 2002. \"Court reverses death sentence.\" Sarasota Herald Tribune, November 8: 7B.</p><p>\u2014. 2000. \"Girl, 17, convicted in killing.\" Sarasota Herald-Tribune, February 18: W6.</p><p>Gainsville Sun. 1999. \"Accessory to murder charges are dropped.\" Gainsville Sun, September 23: 1.</p><p>\u2014. 2000. \"Son of minister gets death sentence.\" Gainsville Sun, May 17.</p><p>Hawkins, Erik. 2020.

Luckily their two young children, who were also in the home, were left unharmed. But who was this stranger in the garage? Had she done this to Julie and then become so distraught afterward that she ended her own life? Chris wasn't sure who she was, but when he was told that the woman was Paula Menendez, ex-wife of Julie's new boyfriend he was pretty sure that was the case.
