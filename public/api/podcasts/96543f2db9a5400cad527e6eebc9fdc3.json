Each week Peloton Instructor, athlete, author &amp; host <strong>Tunde Oyeneyin</strong> will sit down with some of the most interesting experts and personalities from the world of fitness and beyond (Olympians! Musicians! Sociologists! Comedians! Actors!) to challenge and transform some of our own ideas about health, strength and mental wellness, and maybe even ourselves. What does it really mean to be strong? Does competition actually have anything to do with winning? Is the most important thing about pushing hard actually rest? Together, we\u2019ll find out.</p><p>Every Tuesday we will dive deep on a topic and on Friday you will hear a story from a Peloton Member about their lived experience.</p>\n    ",
